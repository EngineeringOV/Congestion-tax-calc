# Questions 

- Is it supposed to be a microservice? Presumably so because of the http interface
- "You may limit the scope to the year 2013." Meaning for the holidays etc? Or the technologies (I.e JDK and Libs)
- "getTax(...)"s stucture implies that there is another service taking take of tracking each individual car and avoid double taxing, otherwise persistance should be added 
- Not sure of the expected directory layout
- Not sure if adding a full framework is allowed but in a realistic scenario this project is a perfect project for Spring
- How is bad input expected to be handled
